>  My dashboard isn’t loading, and I’m really frustrated now.
< 💡 *Friendly Help:* I totally understand how that feels. **Slow Page Load / High Latency**

**Summary:** Users report pages or dashboard loading slowly.

**Recommended Steps:**
1. Get user location, browser, and timestamp of slowness.
2. Check CDN and app server latency metrics and recent scaling events.
3. Suggest simple client fixes: clear cache, disable extensions, try incognito.
4. If server-side, scale up workers or optimize queries; advise Engineering on hotspots.

**Possible Causes:**
- Database slow queries, cache misses, overloaded app instances
- Large client-side assets or third-party scripts
We’ll fix this together!

> Can you provide enterprise pricing for 50+ seats?
< 🙂 *General Help:* **Feature Not Working After Update**

**Summary:** A feature stopped working for users after a recent product update.

**Recommended Steps:**
1. Ask for exact steps to reproduce, browser/OS version, and any console or server errors.
2. Check recent release notes and deployment windows for breaking changes.
3. Recreate issue in staging using the same data; if reproducible, create bug ticket (priority depends on impact).
4. Provide user a temporary workaround if possible and keep them updated on ETA.

**Possible Causes:**
- Regression from new release
- Deprecated API or changed configuration

> OAuth login keeps failing with invalid credentials — is this a token issue?
< 👨‍💻 *Technical Response:* **Login Failure - Invalid Credentials**

**Summary:** Users cannot sign in — they receive an “invalid username or password” error.

**Recommended Steps:**
1. Ask user to confirm username/email and try password reset using the "Forgot password" link.
2. If password reset fails, check whether the user's account is locked due to repeated failed attempts (unlock policy: 15 minutes).
3. Verify account status in admin console (active, disabled, pending verification).
4. If social login used (Google / Apple), confirm OAuth provider connectivity and tokens.

**Possible Causes:**
- Wrong password or username
- Account locked after multiple failed attempts
- Social login token expired or OAuth misconfiguration

You can check the API documentation for deeper details.
